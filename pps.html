								<h3>1) Aadhyaa Shrestha: The Silent Restrictions</h3>
								<p>Every month, when I get my period, I feel like my life comes to a halt. I am not allowed to enter the 
kitchen, to touch any religious items, or even visit the temple. My mother tells me it's because I’m 
‘impure’ during this time, and though I try to explain that I feel the same as always, her words don’t 
change. I stay confined in my room, with nothing to do but wait for the days to pass. It’s as if my 
womanhood is reduced to something shameful. I hate how this makes me feel like I’m being punished for 
something I can’t control. It’s heartbreaking that the world sees periods as something dirty instead of 
natural. </p>

<h3>2) Saanvi Arora: The Constant Awareness </h3>
<p>Periods are a never-ending source of stress for me. Every month, I have to keep track of when they’re 
coming, what I’m wearing, and whether I’ve packed enough sanitary pads. It’s exhausting, especially 
because I can never fully relax. I live in fear of stains and discomfort, constantly checking myself even in 
the middle of conversations. And then, there’s the unspoken taboo of discussing periods openly. If 
someone knows, it's like they see me differently, almost like I’m a burden. Why does something so 
natural feel so suffocating? Why can’t I just be free, without constantly worrying about how others will 
perceive me? </p>

<h3>3) Rinusri Mohankumar: The Weight of Silence </h3>
<p>Every month, my family treats me like I’m an outsider. I’m not allowed to sit on certain furniture, and 
there are whispered conversations about my period that make me feel invisible. It’s as though my body is 
something to be hidden, something to be ashamed of. No one talks about the pain, the cramps, or the 
fatigue. When I tell them I’m in agony, they just brush it off, telling me it’s ‘normal.’ But why does the 
‘normal’ come with so much suffering? I wonder if things will ever change, or if I’ll always be forced to 
endure this silence, carrying the weight of a secret every month. </p>

<h3>4) Samyukta Danda: The Unspoken Struggle </h3>
<p>Being a woman in India means constantly fighting against traditions that try to define me by my periods. 
Every time I get my cycle, I can feel the eyes of my relatives judging me, silent but loud. The whole 
‘don’t enter the kitchen, don’t touch the food, stay away from people’ rule has always made me feel 
inferior. Why should I be isolated during this time? I am expected to endure the cramps and discomfort in 
silence, while everyone around me acts like it's just a ‘phase.’ But it’s so much more than that—it’s about 
my identity, my strength, and my dignity. I wish for a world where periods are seen as natural, and not as 
something that makes me less of a person. </p>
